# Setting Intentions

One of my goals over the last couple of years is to be more intentional in my actions. I think this has worked to some degree, but still could use improvement. I've set up this site for a few reasons: 
 - Play with github pages and actions
 - Write out retrospectives on my adventures 
 - Hopefully enterain a few people like similar blogs have done for me. 

My overall goal going forward will be to write at least one post per action of note. What is an action of note you ask? That's a great question. I don't quite have an answer to yet. That said, I know what it's not. It's not the 2hr ride on the the trail or my multiple trips to the climbing gym. If you're reading this, I probably posted something other than this; so I must have figured it out. 

# What's next? 

Well I'm currently in the midst of job search so I need to beef up my [portfolio]({% link portfolio.md %}). As for adventures, the summer of 23 is still young, and we'll just have to see what kind of trouble I can get into before it's too cold to get outside as much.
