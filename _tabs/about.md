My Name is Jeremy Sebring. I live in Cincinnati, Ohio, US. I highly doubt many people will read this, but I just wanted a place that wasn't just Strava, LinkedIn or god forbid instagram to post about the adventures that I'm up to. Whether they're in rock climbing, cycling, or technology you'll find it here.


If you want to contact me, it's probably easiest to email me or DM me on Linkedin. Both can be found below
